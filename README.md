# Clustering-Toronto-neighborhoods

In this repo we first scrape wikipedia information ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M)
about the neighborhoods of Toronto into a pandas dataframe.
Then we assign the neighborhoods to their geographical coordinates and 
finally explore the neighborhoods' map using the k-means clustering algorithm.
 
Possible repo variations :
- different city
- different clustering algorithm
