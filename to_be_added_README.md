1. convert the already existing k-means method into a k-means class equipped with the following methods : 
- a) the **"Elbow method"** which is a method used to determine the number of clusters for the k-means algorithm
- b) a method that will return the **"Silhouette coefficient"** of a clustering algorithm result

2. Hierarchical clustering repo from scratch
